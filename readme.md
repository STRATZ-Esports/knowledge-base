# Knowledge Base

The STRATZ Knowledge Base is an FAQ that's hosted at https://stratz.com/knowledge-base.  It provides sample questions, which are organized by category and subcategory.

Questions in the Knowledge Base are generated from, and are synced to, the issues contained within this repo.  The title of each issue is the question that's found on the website, and each issue's tag(s) provide the category (required) and subcategory (optional) for each question.

The most commonly viewed questions are marking "Trending", and are prefixed with a fire (ðŸ”¥) emoji.  New or recently updated questions are prefixed with a sparkles (âœ¨) emoji.
